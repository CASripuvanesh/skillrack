A single line L with a set of space separated values indicating distance travelled and time taken is passed as the input. The program must calculate the average speed S (with precision upto 2 decimal places) and print 5 as the output.
Note: The distance and time taken will follow the format DISTANCE@TIMETAKEN, DISTANCE will be in kilometers and TIMETAKEN will be in hours

Input Format:
The first line contains L
Output Format:
The first line contains the average speed S.

Boundary Conditions:
Length of L will be from 3 to 100.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6002 120@3
Output:
36.00 kmph

Explanationc
Total distance = 60+120-180 km.
Total time taken = 2+3 = 5 hours.
Hence average speed = 180/5 = 36.00 Imph
